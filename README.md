# 2D LiDAR Simulator

An interactive **browser-based LiDAR simulator** built with **HTML5 Canvas + JavaScript**.  
It visualizes ray-casting scans with noise, supports random obstacle generation, and lets you navigate a robot through a virtual world.

## ðŸ“– How It Works

### Ray Casting
Each LiDAR beam is modeled as a **ray** from the robotâ€™s position:
